# Sandpile Animation
## 18 Jan 2016 

I initially created this code as a way to better visualize the process of avalanching in sandpile theory, but soon realized that the updated version of the GOOGLE ‘G’ logo lent itself well to an expansion of my previous code for greater flexibility in implementation. The produced video, which contains approximately 1700 full steps of the initial sandpile condensed into one minute, displays the sandpile attempt to stabilize itself. However, the segment in the hook of the G enters into a loop, preventing the GOOGLE ‘G’ from ever stabilizing.

By editing the comment status of various lines in the if statement at the bottom of the document referencing the top-level script environment, it is possible to run the code with different initial matrix states. This is useful for further understanding the process of toppling in sandpile theory. It may also shed light on the characteristics of the avalanche of the GOOGLE ‘G’
